# Kaffee Analyzer

Kaffee Analyzer is a comprehensive lexical, syntax, and semantic analyzer meticulously crafted for the purpose of parsing programs written in our bespoke programming language, Kaffee. This tool has been meticulously developed to fulfill the stringent requirements of a university project, ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and adherence to project specifications.

## Overview

Kaffee Analyzer represents a crucial component in the development and validation process of Kaffee programs. It serves as an indispensable tool for programmers and developers, offering in-depth analysis and verification of code written in the Kaffee language.

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis**: Accurately identifies and categorizes the lexical elements of the Kaffee language, including keywords, identifiers, literals, and symbols.
  
- **Syntax Analysis**: Implements a robust parsing mechanism to validate the syntactic structure of Kaffee programs, ensuring adherence to the defined grammar rules.
  
- **Semantic Analysis**: Performs thorough semantic checks to verify the correctness of program constructs, including type compatibility, variable scope, and adherence to language-specific semantics.
  
- **Error Reporting**: Provides detailed error messages and diagnostics to aid developers in identifying and rectifying issues within Kaffee programs, facilitating a smoother debugging process.
