# Kaffee Analyzer

Kaffee Analyzer is a lexical, syntax, and semantic analyzer developed for the purpose of parsing programs written in our custom programming language, Kaffee. This tool has been developed to fulfill the requirements of a university subject.

## Overview

Kaffee Analyzer represents a crucial component in the development and validation process of Kaffee programs. Attempting to offer in-depth analysis and verification of code written in the Kaffee language.

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis**: Identifies and categorizes the lexical elements of the Kaffee language, including keywords, identifiers, literals, and symbols.
  
- **Syntax Analysis**: Implements a parsing mechanism to validate the syntactic structure of Kaffee programs, ensuring adherence to the defined grammar rules.
  
- **Semantic Analysis**: Performs semantic checks to verify the correctness of program constructs, including type compatibility, variable scope, and adherence to language-specific semantics.
  
- **Error Reporting**: Provides error messages to identify and rectify issues within the written Kaffee programs.

## Usage

To utilize Kaffee Analyzer, simply create a text file and input your Kaffee source code then move said text file to the `tests` folder. The analyzer will then proceed to perform lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis.

## The Team

Kaffee Analyzer would not have been possible without the contributions and support from the following individuals:

- Jerome Saulo
- Geronimo Dayos III
- Francesca Linda Ramos
- Radge Esor Bernardino
